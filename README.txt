Data and code for the paper:
McLean, D. J., & Herberstein, M. E. Mimicry in motion and morphology: do information limitation, tradeoffs or compensation relax selection for mimetic accuracy? 


This project uses behaviour/locomotor mimicry and morphometric analysis to test various hypotheses for imperfect mimicry.


Directory structure
-------------------

data/   - All raw data used for the analysis, plus some intermediate
          results used to store the results of slow analysis stages. See
          data/README.txt for more details.

R/ - Contains R scripts used in the analysis. See R/README.txt for
     details, including R version and installed packages. Running the
     scripts will create a new directory, output, which contains
     output files such as images.
