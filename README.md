#  Mimicry in motion and morphology

Data and code for the paper:
  McLean, D. J., & Herberstein, M. E. Mimicry in motion and morphology: do information limitation, tradeoffs or compensation relax selection for mimetic accuracy? 
  
  
  This project uses behaviour/locomotor mimicry and morphometric analysis to test various hypotheses for imperfect mimicry.


## Directory structure

| Directory | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [`data`](data) | All raw data used for the analysis, plus some intermediate results used to store the results of slow analysis stages. See [`data/README.txt`](data/README.txt) for more details. |
| [`R`](R) | Contains R scripts used in the analysis. See [`R/README.txt`](R/README.txt) for details, including R version and installed packages. Script output (CSV files, images and text files) is written to the [`output`](output) directory. |
| [`output`](output) | Running the scripts generates files in this directory. |
