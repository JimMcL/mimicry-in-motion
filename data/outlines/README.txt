Morphometrics B-W - directory containing outlines, a descriptive spreadsheet and a CSV file, prepared for a different paper by Zoe Wild, retrieved from Google drive https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jlmJrTkhTvcFdZgMRPEQlY4OKQMt8jyq. The file "List - current.csv" was created by exporting the first sheet from the spreadsheet.

sampleIt - directory containing outlines and a descriptive CSV file from my sampleIt database. The directory and its contents were created by running the R script "download outlines.R".

*.rds - cache files used to avoid repeated morphometric analysis as it is very slow.
*.csv - files containing the result of morphometric accuracy calculations for individuals, species and types. The analysis doesn't use these files, they are provided for use from other projects
